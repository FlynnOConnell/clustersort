Welcome to spk2py's Documentation

.. note::
    spk2py is a Python-based framework for processing and analyzing electrophysiological spike data.
    It extracts spike waveforms from raw Spike2 files using the lower-level SonPy library, and then
    performs waveform extraction and spike sorting. It also provides a number of tools for analyzing
    the resulting spike data. Once spikes are sorted, users are able to post-process the spikes using
    plots for mahalanobis distance, ISI, and autocorrelograms. The spike data can also be exported to
    a variety of formats for further analysis in other programs.
